# Career Foundry - Web development course
Start date: 31/01/2016.
Target finish date: 05/08/2016.

### I've started this repo to record my activity and progress on an online web dev course which I've embarked on on a part time basis. 

### The course is meant to prep for the full stack ruby-on-rails development, covering html / css / javascript / bootstrap / jquery / ruby / rails.
## Course breakdown:
1. Responsive website (html/css/bootstratp)
2. Interactive website (javascript/jquery)
3. Basic Rails Web App (ruby/dev enviroment setup/rails)
4. Dynamic Rails Web App (rails)
5. Consumer Web App (rails)
6. Production Ready Web App (rails)

## Repo breakdown:
1. Basics

  First part of the course we focused on the html / css basics while building a [single-page portfolio website](https://mariusz-borowiak.bitballoon.com/). 
  Later on in the course we added some basic jQuery and javascript functionality.
2. Project 1

  The calculator website was part of the javascript achievement.
3. Ruby 1-5

  This repo contains some basic Ruby operations we learned at the beginning of part 3 of the course, before moving into Rails.
4. Testapp

  As the name suggests, just a test application built with Rails to practice the project setup and enviroment configuration.
